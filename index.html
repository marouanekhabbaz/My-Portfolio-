    Hi, I’m Marouane I'm located in New York City, and I used to work as a lab technician, but I'm currently studying software engineering at Thinkful.
     My goal is to get a job as a full-stack developer, I work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Express.js, 
     test-driven-development using the Mocha library, I’m familiar with using API request using Axios library.
      I’m passionate about coding I like solving problems and building programs from scratch,
As a biologist, I learn how to pay attention to details and I improved my analytical thinking skills which helps a lot in programming.
 I’m excited to start my career in Tech so, If you looking to hire a software developer or a partner to help with
